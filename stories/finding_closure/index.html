						<p>On a bright spring morning in Chicago’s Montclare neighborhood, Marica Iza greets friends as they gather on her front lawn. They’ve come to celebrate. After four years of uncertainty, Iza can sleep in the tan brick two-flat behind her without fear. No one can prevent her from making her monthly mortgage payments. She can go for a walk around her quiet residential block without worrying a realtor is waiting at the curb. A bank no longer owns her home.</p> 
						<p>Her friends start setting up. A cardboard cutout of a lifesaver rests against the concrete stoop, the words PRINCIPAL REDUCTION painted in red on a white and blue background. Iza’s daughter, Elizabeth, passes out t-shirts, which the guests pull over their clothing. The shirts bear the name and of their community organization, Centro Autónomo, above their logo, a snail in its shell — with a revolutionary fist where the head should be.</p>
						<p>Iza rents her home from Centro Autónomo, which owns both the house and the land it’s built on. The group bought the property for its community land trust, a non-profit program called Casas del Pueblo that aims to take back homes owned by banks and the federal government and provide affordable housing for the community. But even though Centro technically owns the home, members would say it belongs to Iza, and has for the last 14 years.</p>

						<p>When Iza bought this house, at the corner of Nottingham and Barry, in 2001, she saw it as a longterm investment for her young family. She hated the carpet and the ugly green paint on the walls but loved the big backyard and the second floor, which she could rent out. The place had potential, and Iza thought the same way about her future there. Her fingers bled as she knocked down walls and laid new tile, a fact Iza recalls with pride. “Every touch you see here has my energy there.”</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-3"></div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>But Iza’s real wounds run deeper. In the same space she toiled to create a home, she fought with her now ex-husband. She describes a decade of domestic abuse in which she suffered financial and emotional manipulation. When she filed for divorce, in September 2010, her husband stopped making mortgage payments. Despite her attempts to negotiate with the bank, Iza’s home fell into foreclosure. As her marriage fell apart, the life she had worked and fought for began to slip away.</p>

						</figure>
					
					
						<p>Stories like this are common at Centro Autónomo. A divorce or illness creates a barrier to payment, and the bank, bound to standard operating procedures, forecloses the home without warning. For Centro members, many of whom are low-income, first-generation immigrants, homeownership has deep significance. It represents both the financial and personal security they associate with becoming an American. Yet many of these dreams are doomed to fail. Only a quarter of the working poor — a socioeconomic grouping that constitutes a majority of first-generation immigrants — manage to transition from renting to owning a home, according to a study from the Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology at the University of Washington. And even when those people get homes, just more than half them lose the property within the first five years of buying it.</p>
				
						<p>Cases like that are why Antonio Gutierrez, Centro’s 26-year-old housing coordinator, started the community land trust — to form a permanent solution to the housing crisis faced by working-poor immigrants. Buying back Iza’s home from Fannie Mae is Centro’s first victory in that effort, one that has Gutierrez beaming while he shepherds people into a line for a demonstration on Iza’s lawn. As he starts chanting through a megaphone, she and the others respond, their message clear: “What do we do when the banks attack? Stand up! Fight back!”</p>

						<p class="break">Every surface in Iza&rsquo;s home is immaculate. The glass case in the street-side corner of her living room, filled with photos of her daughter and granddaughter, glints in the morning sunlight. Not a single speck of dust. </p>

						<p>Her brother later suffered a back injury and returned to Ecuador in tk. After living alone for tk years, Iza decided she wanted more stability and decided to marry. When she met her ex-husband, she didn’t think they would ever wed. “I didn’t care for him,” she says, describing the arrangement as one of convenience rather than passion. They bought the home in Montclare together, in 2001, with a down-payment Iza had saved (tk exact amount).</p> 
						
						<p>Iza is the same. Her French-tip manicure is impressively even. Her baby-blue slippers, embroidered with white dandelion petals, imply she&rsquo;s diligent about keeping dirt outside of the house. A former certified nursing assistant, she cleans homes for a living while she studies to become an MRI technician. She likes keeping things in order, and her home is no exception. </p>
						
						<p>The space has considerably more room than her childhood home, in Quito, Ecuador. Iza is a middle child of eight, and she describes the house, which her parents built themselves, as cramped. Between her father and mother, a police sergeant and a homemaker, and her siblings, there was little money to share, too. Hoping to find better work, one of her older brothers decided to immigrate to America, and in 1986, at the age of 19, Iza decided to follow him. </p>
						
						<p>The two shared a one-bedroom apartment in Albany Park for three years. He worked in the kitchen at the Drake Hotel and she took any work she could find &mdash;cleaning houses, sewing clothes in factories. She knew no English when she left Ecuador but she was determined to give herself more opportunities than she had back home. &ldquo;I was willing to do anything to get ahead,&rdquo; she says of her first years in America. After finishing beauty school, in 1992, she was earning enough to live on her own. </p>

						</figure>

						<p>But even though she had gained a financial foothold in her new home, Iza was still an undocumented immigrant. The unplanned birth of her daughter, Elizabeth, in 1991, caused her to worry about her status. Iza worried that, if she were deported, the two could be separated, since Elizabeth was a natural-born citizen. In 2000, a friend suggested a solution &mdash; Iza could marry a citizen, who could then sponsor her own application. The friend gave Iza&rsquo;s phone number to a potential match. She and the man spoke over the phone a few times and decided to meet. But there was little romancing, Iza says. He took her on no formal dates; both were looking to marry more for the financial benefits than for love. Iza didn&rsquo;t really care for the man, but he offered to sponsor her for citizenship. She saw this and a second income as a way to provide a better life for her daughter, now 9. Iza married the man later that year. </p>

						<p>In her mind, marriage was something you simply did to build a home. Iza had her daughter to consider, and having a husband, she reasoned, would give Elizabeth more stability. Part of building that home meant buying a house, which led Iza and her husband to buy the property in Montclare, in January 2001, with a down payment of $12,000 that Iza had saved.  &#160; Both her and her husband were named as owners on the title deed. On the mortgage, however, Iza waived her homestead right. This subtle, handwritten waiver that Iza added below her signature gave her husband unilateral control over the mortgage. In the event of foreclosure, only he would be responsible to the bank. When they signed the mortgage, Iza says both she and her husband didn&rsquo;t fully understand the process of securing the loan, and they both just followed whatever instructions the bank told them to do. </p>

						<p>This distinction of her being on the deed but not named as a borrower on the loan later became ammunition in a series of manipulations by her husband, Iza says, that grew into a decade of financial and emotional abuse. What started as subtle manipulations, such as hiding debt and limiting her spending, grew to more severe threats. When Iza began voicing her intention to separate, her husband responded, she says, by threatening to kill himself. Even after trying to reason with him, she says her husband threatened to call immigration and have her deported if she filed for divorce.</p>

						<p>With help from a social worker, she gained residency, in 2009, through a provision for immigrants in the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. The change in status gave her the security she needed to end the relationship, and in September 2010 she filed for divorce. &#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

						<p>Her husband retaliated, she says, by refusing to make the monthly mortgage payment. When Iza received notice of the missed payment, three months after her husband had stopped paying, she contacted Wells Fargo. She requested to assume the mortgage. As the legal spouse of the mortgagor and joint owner of the home, she reasoned, making these payments should be within her rights. </p>

						<p>Iza called every number at Wells Fargo she hoped would understand her situation. Both the English- and Spanish-speaking representatives told her that only her husband could make the payments. She eventually stopped telling the representatives her name, attempting to avoid the issue of her husband. &ldquo;I would say the property&rsquo;s address, they would hang up the phone. They would literally say, &lsquo;We have nothing to talk to you about.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Wells Fargo offered no comment on this last interaction.)</p>

						<p>After repeated attempts, Iza found a sympathetic ear. When she asked why she could not get any information from the bank over the phone, the representative said Iza&rsquo;s husband had set up a password on the account. This prevented Iza not only from making payments but also invoked protocols that prohibited the bank for even discussing the mortgage with her. Because Iza was not on the loan as a borrower, Wells Fargo says, the bank did not have legal authorization to discuss the account with her.</p>

						<p>In spite of her desire to make payments, Wells Fargo proceeded with a foreclosure in 2011; Iza would attend her court date alone. A judgment of foreclosure was issued on July 1, 2011. Iza had lost her home. But just as her family collapsed, she gained a new one.</p>

						<p>The Albany Park Autonomous Center, known by its Spanish name, Centro Autonomo, is a blip on a block of Lawrence Avenue crammed with multicultural establishments. Selected neighbors include Pita House Bakery, a &ldquo;Middle Eastern and Mexican Bakery&rdquo;; House of Wedding, a Chinese bridal shop; and a Korean bakery [EXAMPLE THAT ISN&rsquo;T ANOTER BAKERY]. Centro&rsquo;s entrance is squished between retail shops and easy to miss. But you start to gain a sense of the organization&rsquo;s character when you climb the stairs to the second floor offices. </p>

						<p>The interior pulses with anti-capitalist propaganda. In the main office, an entire wall is covered with posters that declare, &ldquo;Autonomy is life/Submission is death,&rdquo; &ldquo;Capitalism is a pyramid scheme,&rdquo; and so on. The red fist-for-a-head slug is painted on one of the mustard yellow walls. </p>

						<p>At the back left corner, Antonio Gutierrez, Centro&rsquo;s housing coordinator, sits at his cubicle. His thin black glasses give him a studious look, which makes him seem older than he is. The 26-year-old community organizer has a bright laugh, and even new visitors quickly grow comfortable chatting with him. </p>

						<p>Centro Autonomo serves the Northwest side&rsquo;s Latino community however it can. It offers English as a second language classes, computer training and workshops ranging from urban gardening to housing rights. Gutierrez helps with much of this, but most of his day is spent supporting Casas del Pueblo, Centro&rsquo;s community land trust. </p>

						<p>Starting a land trust is not a new idea in Chicago. Both the city&rsquo;s Department of Planning and Development and a community in the Humboldt Park neighborhood have created non-profit corporations that aim to take control of properties and make them available to low-income residents. Land trusts keep homes affordable to by acquiring the land on which properties are built in long-term leases and then selling the house to community members. Since the homeowners are buying only the house and not the land, the homes sell for much less than market value. They also pay property taxes only on the value of the house, a significant discount from paying taxes on the house and the land.</p>

						<p>Centro Autonomo&rsquo;s land trust follows this basic concept but works using a less conventional method: It proposes that families be able to rent the homes from the land trust. Centro would own both the land and the home, and the rent would cover just taxes and insurance for the property as well as a maintenance fee. That fee would be placed in a savings account of sorts, which the renter could withdraw from to make repairs or improvements to the home. When the family decides to move out, it receives the money left over in the maintenance account. Centro&rsquo;s model would not only allow families to rent homes at prices far below the current market, Gutierrez explains, but also allow them to save and get ahead. </p>


						<p>While Centro and the community land trust&rsquo;s governing decisions are quite deliberate, Iza encountered the organization by accident. On a day off from work, a friend encouraged her to come take computer classes at Centro Aut&oacute;nomo. Iza and her friend went up the flight of stairs that leads to the center that evening to find that the class had been cancelled. In another room, the housing coordinator at the time, Robero de la Riva, was holding a workshop on foreclosure rights. With her evening open, Iza decided to stop in.</p>

						<p>Sitting in a makeshift circle of chairs in Centro&rsquo;s assembly room, she listened to families cry as they recounted stories like her own. Others had fallen behind on mortgage payments because a family member had fallen ill and couldn&rsquo;t work; divorce had left mothers like Iza alone in their homes struggling to support their children. Gutierrez says this experience is common at Centro. At the height of the housing crisis, the community land trust had more than 30 active cases and was coordinating protests almost every week. </p>

						<p>After hearing other families asking for help from Centro to keep their homes, Iza realized she was one of many and shared her story, too. The organizers at Centro took an interest in her case and selected it as one of the first causes of the community land trust. Iza&rsquo;s solitary pleas for help became a throng of angry voices. Soon after meeting de la Riva and the others, Centro organized a protest in front of the Wells Fargo building, in Chicago&rsquo;s financial district. Iza and the others marched west down Madison St, chanting for justice against big banks and waving bright orange and green signs that listed her address: 3066 N Nottingham. </p>

						<p>The extra noise got the bank&rsquo;s attention. At the protest, Iza was able to deliver a letter explaining the circumstances of her divorce and her mortgage. Later that month, the communications department at Wells Fargo called Iza to notify her that it would look into her case. After a string of calls from collections and lawyers, Iza learned that her mortgage had been handed off to the Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as Fannie Mae.

						<p>Working with a national coalition of community organizations, Centro Autonomo gained an opportunity to speak with the directors of Fannie Mae, in Washington, D.C., in January 2012. Little came of the meeting. Each person spoke for their allotted two minutes, received assurance the agency would look into the case &mdash; and nothing more. </p>

						<p>Iza walked away with no progress on her home. But the meeting was an important first step. Fannie Mae had never before sat down with residents of foreclosed homes with the intent of even considering new options for their cases. Instead of feeling defeated, Iza felt empowered. &ldquo;I thought to myself, &lsquo;If I can go this meeting, if I can talk to these executives, I can do it another time, and I can do it better.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

						<p>Emboldened, Iza did everything in her power to find a way to make her home fully hers. &ldquo;I was knocking on every door that I would think there was a possibility of somebody to listen to me.&rdquo; She continued working with Centro Autonomo for the next two years, trying to push her eviction date back and find a way for her to buy the home herself. As the years went by and she had little progress to show for her effort, however, she struggled to maintain the momentum she had gained in Washington. Iza eventually entered a deep depression, in what she describes as her low point. She would break down crying during the middle of the day, sometimes finding it hard to even get out of bed in the morning.</p>

						<p>In addition to the financial and emotional stress of divorce and foreclosure, Iza feared social reprimand. During that period, she hid her foreclosure from friends, family and neighbors. Even trying to speak about it reduced her to tears. Her morning walks, normally a respite, became tinged with anxiety &mdash; that she would come home to a new notice, that her neighbors knew her embarrassing secret.</p>

						<p>&ldquo;Your eyes are trained on the door hoping there will be no sign, nothing hanging on the door. It was just like that, you feel like you're a criminal because you are being treated like one. When you have your house in foreclosure it's like you have a sign on your forehead that says you&rsquo;ve been foreclosed and everybody knows. It is such a sense of embarrassment. It is just unbearable.&rdquo;</p>

						<figure>
							<img class="img-responsive" src="img/Marcia 2.jpg">
							<figcaption>Iza peers into her TV. </figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>Iza&rsquo;s efforts to hide her situation became more difficult as the foreclosure dragged on to its second year. Fannie Mae assigned a realtor to her home. The company does not directly sell homes; instead, it sells them through real estate brokers. The realtor&rsquo;s job was to kick Iza out so he could sell the place. &ldquo;They don't come to your house and ask can you, &lsquo;Please leave your home.&rsquo; They don't do that. They will knock on the door very forcefully like they're going to knock the door down. Their plan is to harass you their plan is to make you afraid of them.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>When Iza came home from a walk one morning, the real estate agent and was waiting outside by the curb with two other men she didn&rsquo;t recognize. They watched her walk inside. Just as she had closed white metal screen door behind her, the men began banging on the frame. Centro Autonomo had taught her that she had no obligation to answer the door, and she concealed herself in her room, avoiding windows, as the men moved on to the side door, the other side door, the back. Iza&rsquo;s daughter hid in her room, clutching Baby, the family pit bull, for protection. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way she felt safe.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>This was one of three major attempts to forcefully evict Iza from her home. Each interaction with the realtor put Iza in a panic, but she found strength and support through Centro Autonomo. &ldquo;They became my family,&rdquo; she says with pride. </p>

						<p>Over the next two years, Iza continued to fight for home. At a market valuation just above $300,000, she could not afford to repurchase the property on her own. Her appeals for negotiation were denied, and a final notice of eviction was set for January 9, 2015. On that day, the Sheriff would be permitted to come into the house and forcibly remove Iza. Running out of options, she began packing her home of 14 years into boxes. </p>

					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>But the week before the deadline, Gutierrez secured one final opportunity &mdash; he, Iza and a national coalition of community organizations would travel to the capital to meet with Mel Watt, the newly appointed director of Fannie Mae, and plead their cases. With the meeting scheduled one day before her eviction, Iza felt determined to win what she saw as her final chance.  &ldquo;I had a sense of entitlement,&rdquo; she says smiling. &ldquo;I thought, &lsquo;You know what? You&rsquo;re not taking my home.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

						<p>Around a conference table in a small room at Fannie Mae&rsquo;s Washington headquarters, Iza, Gutierrez and 13 others sat in an intimate conversation with Watt. Unlike the previous visit, Watt listened to every story in full. Each person who spoke was in imminent danger of losing their home, some in the next two weeks and others, like Iza, in only days. </p>

						<p>Many of the advocates were immigrants. Iza cried as she listened to stories like her own, and some who had suffered even longer than her. The most powerful story came from a family that had emigrated from a war-torn country, where they had lost their home in the fighting. They had come to America to find stability, only to be sucked into another war, this time fighting for their new home. </p>

						<p>Watt responded personally to each story. After the meeting, he came up to each person who spoke to help address his or her situation. When he got to Iza, she took his hands in hers and told him she refused to leave without some form of progress. &ldquo;I said to him, &lsquo;Mr. Watt, I'm not going home empty handed. You need to do something. By doing something with me you'd be doing something with many people who are in the same situation.&rsquo;&rdquo;   Watt gave her the name of someone from the Federal Housing Finance Agency who, he assured, would help with her specific case. </p>

						<p>The buyback was authorized and the eviction was postponed. Fannie Mae gave Iza its final offer offer: Centro Autonomo could buy the house back at the reduced cost of $225,000 &mdash; $25,000 less than Fannie Mae&rsquo;s initial quote. She and Antonio decided the price was low enough and they accepted the deal.</p>

						<p>When Iza returned to Chicago later that night, she started unpacking the boxes. She wanted to feel that she hadn&rsquo;t given up, that she and Centro Autonomo would be able to finalize the buyback. But most of all, she wanted to make her house a home again. And for the first time in four years, she could see an approaching end to her ordeal.</p>

						<p class="break">While the bottom floor of Iza&rsquo;s home is well decorated and filled with personal items, there&rsquo;s still plenty of work she hopes to do. The basement is painted a plain, eggshell white, and save for a few stray tools the space is empty. It won&rsquo;t be much longer. This summer Iza&rsquo;s daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter will move in below her. The second floor also sits vacant, waiting for furniture. A couple is moving in next month, renting the upper floor. Iza is now not just a homeowner, but a landlord as well. </p>

						<p>The backyard is an unruly rectangular patch of weeds. Like when she moved into the home, Iza sees potential for this space. As she looks out from her back porch, extending from the second floor, she points at an area she&rsquo;d like to put lawn furniture. Her neighbor is working is on his own yard, and when he notices her standing there, he waves hello. She waves back, no longer afraid.  Now that Centro Autonomo has secured her home, Iza feels ready to put the last 15 years behind her. To help the transition, she began throwing away the mass of files she had kept documenting her foreclosure process. But she kept a few papers. Iza is saving them for her 1-year-old granddaughter, Arianna. </p>

						<p>She wants her granddaughter see the house&rsquo;s history and think, &rdquo;I have a piece of land in America that my grandmother fought for.&rdquo; </p>
